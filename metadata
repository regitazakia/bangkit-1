Metadata for IBM Data.csv

Context:
IBM HR Employee Attrition & Performance data is a fictional data set created by IBM data scientist. HR data is very rare to find because it’s not usually well archived, so IBM data scientist made the data as an exercise to analyse human resources data. With this data, we can uncover the factors that lead to employee attrition and explore important questions such as ‘show me a breakdown of distance from home by job role and attrition’ or ‘compare average monthly income by education and attrition’.
